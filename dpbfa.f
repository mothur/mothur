      subroutine dpbfa(abd,lda,n,m,info)

      integer lda,n,m,info
      double precision abd(lda,n)
c
c     dpbfa factors a double precision symmetric positive definite
c     matrix stored in band form.
c
c     dpbfa is usually called by dpbco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.
c
c     on entry
c
c        abd     double precision(lda, n)
c                the matrix to be factored.  the columns of the upper
c                triangle are stored in the columns of abd and the
c                diagonals of the upper triangle are stored in the
c                rows of abd .  see the comments below for details.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  abd .
c                lda must be .ge. m + 1 .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c        m       integer
c                the number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
c                0 .le. m .lt. n .
c
c     on return
c
c        abd     an upper triangular matrix  r , stored in band
c                form, so that  a = trans(r)*r .
c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  for normal return.
c                = k  if the leading minor of order  k  is not
c                     positive definite.
c
c     band storage
c
c           if  a  is a symmetric positive definite band matrix,
c           the following program segment will set up the input.
c

c                         k = i-j+m+1
