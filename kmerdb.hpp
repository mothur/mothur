 *	This class is a child class of the Database class, which stores the template sequences as a kmer table and provides
 *	a method of searching the kmer table for the sequence with the most kmers in common with a query sequence.
 *	kmerLocations is the primary storage variable that is a two-dimensional vector where each row represents the
 *	different number of kmers and each column contains the index to sequences that use that kmer.
 *
 *	Construction of an object of this type will first look for an appropriately named database file and if it is found
 *	then will read in the database file (readKmerDB), otherwise it will generate one and store the data in memory
 *	(generateKmerDB)
