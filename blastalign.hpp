 *	This is a basic alignment method that gets the blast program to do the heavy lifting.  In the future, we should
 *	probably incorporate NCBI's library so that we don't have to call on a user-supplied executable.  This is a child
 *	of the Alignment class, which requires a constructor and align method.
