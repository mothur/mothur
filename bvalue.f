c     The nontrivial knot interval  (t(i),t(i+1))  containing  x  is lo-
c  cated with the aid of  interv . The  k  b-coeffs of  f  relevant for
c  this interval are then obtained from  bcoef (or taken to be zero if
c  not explicitly available) and are then differenced  jderiv  times to
c  obtain the b-coeffs of  (d**jderiv)f  relevant for that interval.
c  Precisely, with  j = jderiv, we have from x.(12) of the text that
c
c     (d**j)f  =  sum ( bcoef(.,j)*b(.,k-j,t) )
c
c  where
c                   / bcoef(.),                     ,  j .eq. 0
c                   /
c    bcoef(.,j)  =  / bcoef(.,j-1) - bcoef(.-1,j-1)
c                   / ----------------------------- ,  j .gt. 0
c                   /    (t(.+k-j) - t(.))/(k-j)
c
c     Then, we use repeatedly the fact that
c
c    sum ( a(.)*b(.,m,t)(x) )  =  sum ( a(.,x)*b(.,m-1,t)(x) )
c  with
c                 (x - t(.))*a(.) + (t(.+m-1) - x)*a(.-1)
c    a(.,x)  =    ---------------------------------------
c                 (x - t(.))      + (t(.+m-1) - x)
c
c  to write  (d**j)f(x)  eventually as a linear combination of b-splines
c  of order  1 , and the coefficient for  b(i,1,t)(x)  must then be the
c  desired number  (d**j)f(x). (see x.(17)-(19) of text).
